This Python script automates the process of identifying and mapping broken links on large-scale websites. It validates URLs from a sitemap and an input list of broken URLs, calculates similarity scores to suggest the closest matching links, and outputs results in a user-friendly Excel report.

Features
	•	Sitemap Parsing: Extracts all URLs from an XML sitemap.
	•	Broken Link Validation: Checks the status of URLs and identifies broken links using HTTP response codes and page content.
	•	URL Matching: Suggests the most similar working URL for each broken link using the difflib library.
	•	Excel Reporting: Outputs a detailed report including:
	•	Broken URL
	•	Suggested replacement URL
	•	Similarity score
	•	HTTP status code

Requirements
	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Libraries:
	•	asyncio
	•	playwright
	•	beautifulsoup4
	•	openpyxl
	•	nest_asyncio
	•	difflib

 To install the dependencies, run: pip install -r requirements.txt

 Installation

 	1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/broken-link-mapping.git cd broken-link-mapping
  2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
  3. Install Playwright browsers:playwright install

Usage
1. Place your broken URLs list in an Excel file named broken urls.xlsx. The file should have a single column of URLs starting from row 2.
2. Run the script: python script_name.py
3. Follow the prompt to enter your XML Sitemap URL
4. The script will generate an Excel file named url_mapping.xlsx with the mapping results.

Output

The output Excel file contains the following columns:
	•	Broken URL: The original broken URL from your input file.
	•	Suggested URL: The closest match from the sitemap.
	•	Similarity Score: A numerical score representing the match quality.
	•	Status Code: The HTTP status code of the broken URL

Known Limitations
	•	The script assumes the sitemap URL is accessible and well-formed.
	•	Matching relies on string similarity, which may not always align with semantic context.
	•	The script may not handle extremely large sitemaps efficiently without increasing timeout limits.
